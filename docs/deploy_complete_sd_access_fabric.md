**Note**: This comprehensive example demonstrates a full SD-Access fabric deployment with all necessary components: site hierarchy, IP addressing, fabric configuration, device provisioning, and configuration templates.

## 🚀 Quick Start

The NAC approach enforces a strict **separation of data from code** - a key principle that simplifies maintenance and enables reusability:
  
- **Code** (`main.tf`): Minimal "glue" file that links data to the NAC module
  - References the community-maintained NAC module from Terraform registry
  - Rarely changes - only when updating module version or directory structure

- **Data** (`data/` directory): Contains the desired state of your network in YAML files
  - Site hierarchy, IP pools, network settings - everything specific to YOUR environment
  - Can be updated independently without touching the Terraform code

This separation means you maintain only your network's desired state (YAML data), while the complex Terraform logic is handled by the centrally-maintained NAC module. Multiple teams can use the same proven codebase with their own configuration data.

**Learn More:** [Separate Data from Code Concept](https://netascode.cisco.com/docs/guides/concepts/separate_data_from_code/)

### 1. main.tf file

The `main.tf` file is the entry point for your Terraform deployment. It defines:
- **Provider Configuration**: Which Terraform provider to use (Catalyst Center)
- **Authentication**: How to connect to your Catalyst Center instance (URL, credentials)
- **NAC Module**: References the Network-as-Code module for simplified configuration
- **YAML Location**: Specifies where your configuration files are located (`data/` directory)

#### 1.1 Inspect the main.tf file

The `main.tf` file has been modified to point to the Catalyst Center in your lab, use the CiscoDevNet/catalystcenter terraform provider and the terraform module for Network as code for Catalyst Center


### 2. Inspect Data Folder

The `data/` folder contains all the YAML configuration files that define your SD-Access fabric infrastructure. These files work together to create a complete, production-ready SD-Access fabric deployment.

#### 2.1 Site Hierarchy (`sites.nac.yaml`)

Defines the site hierarchy including areas (Global, Poland, Krakow), buildings (Bld A), and floors. This establishes the geographic and logical organization of your network.

#### 2.2 Network Settings (`network_settings.nac.yaml`)

Contains IP addressing and network services configuration including the global Overlay IP pool (192.168.0.0/16), its four reservations (CampusVN, GuestVN, PrintersVN, BYOD), and AAA server settings for ISE integration.

#### 2.3 Fabric Configuration (`fabric.nac.yaml`)

Defines the SD-Access fabric components including Layer 3 Virtual Networks (L3VNs), fabric sites, anycast gateways, border devices, and L3 handoffs with BGP peering to external networks.

#### 2.4 Network Devices (`devices.nac.yaml`)

Specifies the network devices to be added to inventory and their fabric roles - one border router (BR10) with control plane and border node roles, and two edge nodes (EDGE01, EDGE02) with port assignments for user connectivity.

**Note**: All devices are configured with `state: INIT`, which means they will be added to the inventory but not fully provisioned. This allows you to verify device discovery and role assignment before proceeding with full provisioning.

![Device BR10 State INIT](images/deploy_complete_sd_access_fabric/Device_BR10_State_INIT.png)

#### 2.5 Network Profiles (`network_profiles.nac.yaml`)

Contains network profiles used for device provisioning and configuration templates.

#### 2.6 Configuration Templates (`templates.nac.yaml`)

References configuration templates (like ACL_Block.j2) that can be applied to devices for consistent policy enforcement.


### 3. Verify Initial Catalyst Center Configuration

Before deploying any configuration, verify that Catalyst Center has no sites, IP address pools, or fabric configuration:

1. Login to the Catalyst Center GUI using your credentials
2. Navigate to **Design > Network Hierarchy** to verify no sites exist (only the default "Global" site should be present)
3. Navigate to **Design > Network Settings > IP Address Pools** to verify no IP pools are configured
4. Navigate to **Provision > Fabric** to verify no fabric sites are configured

This baseline verification ensures you're starting with a clean slate and will help you clearly see the SD-Access fabric resources created by Terraform in the next step.

### 3. Deploy Base Configuration

Deploy the complete SD-Access fabric infrastructure:

```bash
terraform init
```

Review the changes:
```bash
terraform plan
```

Deploy to Catalyst Center:
```bash
terraform apply
```

**Expected Result**: ✅ Success on first apply - all 50+ resources created
- 3 Areas (Global, Poland, Krakow)
- 1 Building (Bld A)
- 2 Floors (Floor 1, Floor 2)
- 1 Global IP Pool (Overlay) with 4 reservations
- 4 IP Pool Reservations (CampusVN, GuestVN, PrintersVN, BYOD)
- 4 Layer 3 Virtual Networks (Campus, Guest, Printers, BYOD)
- 1 Fabric Site (Krakow) with 4 anycast gateways
- 3 Fabric Devices (BR10, EDGE01, EDGE02) with fabric roles
- 1 L3 Handoff with BGP peering
- AAA Server configuration (ISE integration)
- Network profiles and templates

### 4. Verify Catalyst Center Configuration

After the successful Terraform deployment, verify that the SD-Access fabric infrastructure has been configured correctly in Catalyst Center:

1. **Login to Catalyst Center GUI** using your credentials

2. **Verify Site Hierarchy**:
   - Navigate to **Design > Network Hierarchy**
   - Confirm all 3 areas are present:
     - Global
     - Poland
     - Krakow
   - Expand each area to verify the building (Bld A) and 2 floors are correctly created

3. **Verify IP Address Pools**:
   - Navigate to **Design > Network Settings > IP Address Pools**
   - Confirm the global IP pool exists:
     - Overlay (192.168.0.0/16)

   ![Confirm Global Pool Exists](images/deploy_complete_sd_access_fabric/Confirm_Global_Pool_Exists.png)
     
   - Click on the pool to verify the 4 reservations:
     - CampusVN-IPPool (192.168.100.0/24)
     - GuestVN-IPPool (192.168.101.0/24)
     - PrintersVN-IPPool (192.168.102.0/24)
     - BYOD-IPPool (192.168.103.0/24)

   ![Confirm Building Pool Reservations](images/deploy_complete_sd_access_fabric/Confirm_Building_Pool_Reservations.png)

4. **Verify SD-Access Fabric**:
   - Navigate to **Provision > Fabric**
   - Confirm the fabric site **Krakow** is present

   ![Navigate to Fabric Sites](images/deploy_complete_sd_access_fabric/Navigate_to_Fabric_Sites.png)

   ![Verify Fabric Site Exists](images/deploy_complete_sd_access_fabric/Verify_Fabric_Site_Exists.png)

   ![Verify Krakow Site Exists](images/deploy_complete_sd_access_fabric/Verify_Krakow_Site_Exists.png)

   - Verify all 4 Layer 3 Virtual Networks are configured:
     - Campus
     - Guest
     - Printers
     - BYOD

   ![Verify VNs Exist](images/deploy_complete_sd_access_fabric/Verify_VNs_Exist.png)

   - Verify IP Transit exists

   ![Verify IP Transit Exists](images/deploy_complete_sd_access_fabric/Verify_IP_Transit_Exists.png)

   - Navigate to **Provision > Inventory** 

   ![Navigate to Provision Inventory](images/deploy_complete_sd_access_fabric/Navigate_to_Provision_Inventory.png)

   - Set focus to **Provision**. Verify that the 3 fabric devices (BR10, EDGE01, EDGE02) are neither assigned to any site nor provisioned

   ![Provision Inventory Focus Provision Devices not assigned](images/deploy_complete_sd_access_fabric/Provision_Inventory_Focus_Provision_Devices_not_assigned.png)

   

This verification step ensures your Terraform deployment successfully created all the expected SD-Access fabric resources.

4. **Provision the Border Device**

To provision border device open devices.nac.yaml file in data/ folder and change state attribute from INIT to PROVISION on BR10.cisco.eu device.

Point your mouse over the INIT word and wait for intellisense to show you the available valid states

![Use Intellisense to visualize valid states](images/deploy_complete_sd_access_fabric/Device_BR10_Hover_And_verify_avaialble_states.png)

You can also check the [Device States documentation](https://netascode.cisco.com/docs/data_models/catalyst_center/inventory/device/#device-states) for detailed information about each state and their transitions.

Change the state from `INIT` to `PROVISION` for the BR10 device:

```yaml
---
catalyst_center:
  inventory:
    devices:
      - name: BR10
        fqdn_name: BR10.cisco.eu
        device_ip: 198.18.130.10
        pid: C9KV-UADP-8P
        state: PROVISION  # Changed from INIT to PROVISION
        device_role: BORDER ROUTER
        site: Global/Poland/Krakow/Bld A
        fabric_site: Global/Poland/Krakow
        fabric_roles:
          - BORDER_NODE
          - CONTROL_PLANE_NODE
```

Save the file and deploy the change:

```bash
terraform plan
```

Review the planned changes to verify only the BR10 device state will be updated:

```bash
terraform apply
```

Terraform will prompt you to confirm the changes. Review the planned actions and type `yes` to proceed:

```
Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes
```

Command execution will take around 2 to 3 minutes.

**Expected Result**: ✅ Device state updated - BR10 will be provisioned

**Verify in Catalyst Center**:
- Refresh your browser page in the Catalyst Center GUI
- Navigate to **Provision > Inventory** and set focus to **Provision**
- Verify that BR10 device shows as provisioned
- Check that the device configuration has been applied
- Confirm the border router role is correctly assigned
- Navigate to **Provision > Fabric Sites**, select Krakow fabric
- Verify in the **Fabric Infrastructure** tab that the device has been added with border and control plane roles

5. **Provision the Edge Devices**

To provision the edge devices, open the devices.nac.yaml file in the data/ folder and change the state attribute from INIT to PROVISION on both EDGE01.cisco.eu and EDGE02.cisco.eu devices.

Point your mouse over the INIT word and wait for IntelliSense to show you the available valid states.

You can also check the [Device States documentation](https://netascode.cisco.com/docs/data_models/catalyst_center/inventory/device/#device-states) for detailed information about each state and their transitions.

Change the state from `INIT` to `PROVISION` for both EDGE01 and EDGE02 devices:

```yaml
---
catalyst_center:
  inventory:
    devices:
      - name: EDGE01
        fqdn_name: EDGE01.cisco.eu
        device_ip: 198.18.130.1
        pid: C9KV-UADP-8P
        state: PROVISION  # Changed from INIT to PROVISION
        device_role: ACCESS
        site: Global/Poland/Krakow/Bld A
        fabric_site: Global/Poland/Krakow
        fabric_roles:
          - EDGE_NODE
        port_assignments:
          - interface_name: GigabitEthernet1/0/2
            connected_device_type: "USER_DEVICE"
            data_vlan_name: "192_168_100_0-Campus"
            authenticate_template_name: "No Authentication"
      - name: EDGE02
        fqdn_name: EDGE02.cisco.eu
        device_ip: 198.18.130.2
        pid: C9KV-UADP-8P
        state: PROVISION  # Changed from INIT to PROVISION
        device_role: ACCESS
        site: Global/Poland/Krakow/Bld A
        fabric_site: Global/Poland/Krakow
        fabric_roles:
          - EDGE_NODE
        port_assignments:
          - interface_name: GigabitEthernet1/0/3
            connected_device_type: "USER_DEVICE"
            data_vlan_name: "192_168_100_0-Campus"
            authenticate_template_name: "No Authentication"
```

![EDGE01 and EDGE02 Provisioning](images/deploy_complete_sd_access_fabric/EDGE01_02_Provisioning.gif)

Save the file and deploy the changes:

```bash
terraform plan
```

Review the planned changes to verify only the EDGE01 and EDGE02 device states will be updated:

```bash
terraform apply
```

Terraform will prompt you to confirm the changes. Review the planned actions and type `yes` to proceed:

```
Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes
```

Command execution will take around 4 to 6 minutes (both devices are provisioned in parallel).

**Expected Result**: ✅ Device states updated - EDGE01 and EDGE02 will be provisioned

**Verify in Catalyst Center**:
- Refresh your browser page in the Catalyst Center GUI
- Navigate to **Provision > Inventory** and set focus to **Provision**
- Verify that both EDGE01 and EDGE02 devices show as provisioned
- Check that the device configurations have been applied
- Confirm the edge node roles are correctly assigned
- Navigate to **Provision > Fabric Sites**, select Krakow fabric
- Verify in the **Fabric Infrastructure** tab that both devices have been added with edge node roles
